When asked to prove bookings done by them, they failed miserably.

"Saw today's news, that HC Delhi, clear the decks for TATA Sons to pay US$1.18 Billions to DoCoMo for honouring its commitment made while DocoMo agreed to purchase26% stake in Tata Tele services in 2009 at US$2.7Billion.(The then prevailing market price.)

All tax experts are hailing the judgement as, gr8 transperent and strong legal system. This judgenent will encourage more FDI . Blah blah blah.

I fail to understand, all that is fine, ""to uphold the agreement"". However such protection is not available to all sundry.

When we, retail investers purchase shares at the then prevailing market price, why we are not allowed to incorporate such clause, ""should the market price fall 50% of it, Company should give us back at least 50% of the price at which we had purchased the share in market.""

 That time the clause is , ""Investment in market is subject to risk, you may loose your money completely, kindly take advice from experts before investing.""

To understand more clearly a retail invester's agony, lets take an example. Many must have invested in IPOs at a premium , in ""Co A"", believing  tall claims made by promoters. They invested in Rs.10 face valyed share at say Rs225.00 in say 2009 same time when Docomo invested in Tata Tele Services.

Sadly today the said "" Co A"" share market price falls to Rs3.00.

Now can any one of these investers, such aggrived retail invrster approch the company to pay atleast Rs112.50 ( 50% of stake price invested). Just like DoCoMo approaching Tata Sons, to repurchase their shares at 50% of stake price.

I know, tax experts (hailing the Delhi HC judgement ) will say, where is the agreement between the company and retail investers?

Thats exactly, where the shoe pinches. All our system, laws tries to protect interests of super HNIs only.

If Delhi HC feels such clause of protecting 50% of stakeholders price is fair, should not The Govt too amended suitably the existing Company Law, in oder to protect retail investers stakes in comoany.? There pl don't insist on defence, our clause clearly states, your investnents are subject to market risks, may loose your money in entireity.

Will RBI go ahead to appeal in SC? Will our Govt force the pramoters to safeguard the retail investers investments? Well may not be at 50% of their market priced investment, but on some clearly defined prorata basis.",NAG

"Why Ola &amp; Uber are ponzis. ??? 

By definition a ponzi is a fraud scheme that promises high and quick returns to the original investors at the cost of new investors . 

In Ola and Uber , the old investors were drivers and owners who put in their own cars with assurance from Ola and Uber of business per day of at least rs 3000 per day . 
Photo no 1 proof . Misleading advertisements. 

2) once the car owner investors got human resource and trained their drivers and took responsibility of accidents, Ola ma0ement introduced their own fleet. ( mainly Maruti swift Desire, Sx 4 &  Datsun cars ) They also poached drivers of investor cars promising them ownership of company cars if they drove currently at a low wage as low as 3-4000 per month. To penalise drivers of investor cars , Ola started giving false bookings to drivers and levies penalty if drivers cancelled those . Deliberate false calls and waiting for client , if cancelled by driver - penalty ! 
Proof photo no 2 

Fraud business showed navigation of client pick up through Arabian sea , proving navigational errors in the software of Ola & Uber . 

Proof photo no 3 
Penalty was levied on drivers for not taking those calls. 

All complaints made at Andheri Police station but no FIR/ NC made . Senior PI hand in glove with Ola officials . False cases registered against drivers for  violence during peaceful demonstration. video of senior PI Andheri East police station, apologising to Taxi drivers sanghatana for false cases being told to do so by seniors and Ola officials , available on what  App and to the media . Statements of taxi Union leaders were taken yesterday . 

Here the old investors are duped and new investors seem to be the government with probable tie ups with companies like Swift for desire models , Sx4 Datsun . Japanese collaboration. 

Tip : SX4  Desires have serious blind spot problems . Incoming traffic from right side is not visualised properly due to narrow windscreen and small window size . The GPRS systems employed by cabs on mobiles are stuck on same side as the blind spot mirror , making it more difficult to visualise incoming traffic. The models were hence discontinued . If those are passed on for public transport , it would be a serious public safety issue .",NAG

Electronics Media decided it from long time with Communists and Congressis, IAS/IPS, Judges decided to take assistance in these three directions to prove them how great capable people they are after 70 years of their assistance. Considering Sc-St their own relatives informed them those traditional jobs are to exploit them, therefore they should hate and leave those crores of job and enjoy lakhs of Govt. job, let those crores of low strata jobs like Laundry, tailor, Saloon Trawlers etc filled with tolerant people. In this way, there should not be any compulsion of ritual to have presence in marriage or death ceremony to other Hindu customaries to compel worst rich people like Ambani to request you their home.:/",NAG

"The first budget of Independent India was  presented on 26th November ,1947, by country's first finance  minister RK Shamukham Chetty ,a lawyer ,politician and an economist.No new taxes were proposed as it was an interim budget and the date of annual budget presentation for 1948-49 was just 95 days away.Mr Chetty was asked to step down by PM Nehru shortly afterwards due to minor dereliction of duty by subordinate official to ensure probity.Almost 70 years ago on February 28,in British India , the interim budget was presented by the then Finance Minister in Lord Wavell's cabinet ,Liaquat Ali Khan , who later became first  Prime Minister of Pakistan.His budget was termed as pro poor budget.Salt Tax was completely abolished ,income tax limit raised from  Rs2000 to Rs 2500, heavy taxes were introduced for business  establishments having income of Rs 1,00,000 or more  and a  Commission of Inquiry  was proposed to investigate those who made huge sums of money during WWII.The left  wing of the Indian National Congress (INC) headed by Pt.Nehru and Maulana Azad welcomed  the budget while the right wing headed by C.Rajagopalachari opposed it as the business houses hit by the budget were the main financiers of the INC.Critics of the budget described it as an attempt by Mr Khan to drive wedge between right and left wing of the INC.In independent India ,the budget  of 1985 presented by the then Finance Minister V.P. Singh was hailed as landmark budget by none other than the eminent jurist and tax wizard late Nani Palkhivala , who previously had criticized all other budgets.",NAG

"Those who seek parity with Army.

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER‚Ä¶ 

While troopers of PMFs, CPOs, CAPFs seek parity with the Armed Forces in service benefits, 

can they answer following questions:
[Officers form less than 3% of 12.6 Lakh strong Army yet their casualties rate is 11.5%. Is it foolish fatal attraction with death? No way sir, he does it because of what is ingrained in him: My own Safety & Welfare comes Last, Always & Every time. That he would let harm come to his men, 'paltan's izzat' or to innocent citizen, only over his dead body].

Q1. Has he served along with Army anywhere ?

Q2. Had he gone to Siachin ever ?

Q3. Is he aware what's the retirement age of jawaan in army ?

Q4. Had he ever compared availability of married accommodation to army with that of PMF ?

Q5. Is he aware that Army is yet to get 7th CPC?

Q6. Is he aware in the entire service , for how much duration Army personnel keep their families along with them and ever compared with the duration of PMF personnels ?

Q7. He talks about casual leave of army but is he aware that out of that leave how much is availed ?

Q8. Is he aware that army is doing additional task of maintaining internal peace in which they have failed the nation?

Q9. Is he aware about the illness rate in army and the diseases which are common to army personnel? Ever tried to compare the death rate of the Army with other forces?

Q10. Is he aware that his departmental officers come under a specific group of service and in places like Guwahati will get more then double the allowance what army officers will get in Siachin Glacier? If that's the difference among the officer cadre then how come Army jawaan can be better?

Q11. Had he ever seen his assistant commandants walking through out with his troops during Road Opening Patrol ?

Q12. Had he ever compared the casualty rate between the two forces?

Q13. Was he stopped by someone from joining the Army ?

Q14. Most of the Army jawaans retire by 40yrs of age whereas PMF personnel's serves 15 to 20 years more. If he adds the total pay received by him in serving this additional tenure, he will find himself getting almost thrice in comparison to the army personnel's.

Q 15. Does any of his officers lead from the front to take the hail of the first bullets with the troops following behind?

Q16. Is he not aware that most of the PMF jawaans become equivalent to a JCO whereas in army it is not even 10% ?

There are several other questions too....But here aim is not to raise questions against any organization. Everyone is doing his job, everyone has own problems.

‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù

Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India

India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land

"#Mohsin_Khan Islam is a religion of hate. This religion particularly attracts the angry people and the hardened criminals. Most converts to Islam are prison inmates. They are emotionally unbalanced. They feel that they are victimized and they are angry at the world. Islam is a perfect religion for them. It validates their sense of victimization and provides then a definable enemy to hate. The new converts to Islam find a sense of direction in their lives that they never had before. However that is not the direction towards love, inner peace and enlightenment. In Islam they find a venue to express their anger, this time with no bang of conscience but with conviction, determination and a sense of purpose.  Political correctness is a major defect of the western ethos. Some Western countries have even passed blasphemy laws that would put you in legal hot waters if you say anything negative about Islam. This means that the truth about Islam cannot be said but Muslims are given total freedom to spread their religion with lies. Islam thrives were truth is suppressed. That is one reason that westerners convert to Islam. They are lied to. How do you expect a society to survive when truth is banned and lies are allowed? In west lack of political correctness, moral declination and innocency towards Islam and Islamic People in westerns are some of the reasons. In Muslim controlled countries, cunning Islamic laws and high birth rate are main reasons. In East love jihad, vigorous advertising of islam by degrading other religions,  fear blackmailing and Excessive highly birth rate of muslims infants are major reasons for muslim's high population growth rate. So where is the merit of islam in conversions?  Merit of islam in conversions is to provide all pseudo reasons for further immoral actions by new Muslims.",OAG

denies to be a slave of her then he and his famly will be threaten by false

BETTER THEN THESE MARRIED BITCHES, at least these prostitutes makes money in a
honest way and do not cheat their customers and do not spoil their family at
all but these bitches asks millions in the favors of getting fucked for few
nights and their parents who are retired and brother who is in drugs and do
not make any money then for these basterds teach this bitch girl to marry a
innocent guy and get fucked for few nights and then fuck their in laws family
by putting false dowry case so brides family can feed their self with the
money got as compromise called ""REVERSE DOWRY "".After getting money as
settlement these bitches and their family starts hunting for another man
.Indian judicial system knows everything but do not want to do anything and
makes money out of it..sure every one will get lesson because every one has
son and daughter and their daughter in law files the same dawry case against
their son then they will realize and learn the lesson.The people are too
scared to marry a girl once get married and if threaten by girl to file false
case then it will happen that people will kill her and her family before going
to jail after all once they charged in false dowry case then there is no
chance left for compromise except kill them all as only left option as JUSTICE
.so now its upto indian court what they want? do they want to keep these
bitches filling false case one by one and get killed by their husband ???or
court will have the option to do proper investigartion before arrest and if

I myself as a girl found out to be wrong therefore i didn't even watch the
whole series unlike you. You can't compare a web series with a film. Films are
meant to put impact on people & what Kabir Singh shows is disgusting because
he kept on calling preeti ki she is my Bandi she doesn't have her own
personality (i know why you ppl liked this movie because it's India).  
Third: Do you liked movie veere di wedding??????? As a girl I didn't watch
movie because it literally showed girls being a bit more sort of bad. You ppl

and so is toxic masculinity. I totally understand that you have a lot of
hatred for liberals n feminists which is justified coz of what a lot of them
have been propogating but not every idea of feminism is wrong pratik.
Bollywood has a history of showing these things ""cool"", that is my only
problem with these characters. I am all game for negative characters but I
don't like them being glorified, making them look cool. I won't even start
with 4 shots, I didn't even like alia's aggresion in gully boy so it's not one
sided. As much as I enjoy your views on nationalism, our history , I didn't
feel comfortable watching this. üôè",CAG

"I agree with you but I have a point too. Before elaborating my point, I want
to let you know that I'm here after seeing the ""Joker Movie analysis"". I
firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't
have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later
part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self
derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your
Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called
the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of
person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would
our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir
Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality
disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger ma0ement
issue.
Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him
precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian
suffer from depression; 5 out of 100.

I hope you all get my message well.  
Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy
and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.  
  
HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE
CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION.

You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we
should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all

with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the
HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration!  
Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti
for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him,
which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too..

"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I‚Äôm the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I‚Äôm
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can‚Äôt say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn‚Äôt exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don‚Äôt even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I‚Äôm a man. I am a man ‚Äì I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it‚Äôs being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don‚Äôt return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world‚Äôs problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the ‚ÄúPatriarchy‚Äù which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I‚Äôm sick of it. I‚Äôm not a catcaller, I‚Äôm not a wife beater, and
I‚Äôm not a rapist. But I‚Äôm held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that‚Äôs bullshit. And it‚Äôs exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don‚Äôt hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don‚Äôt need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn‚Äôt hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is ‚Äì destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",CAG

should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a
macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i

okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a

and criticised openly. Some will say ""Oh it is just a film."" But many people
DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their

followers you have.  
  
Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.
For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for
killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be
considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse.

"Dear Pratik,  
Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men
and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring
to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially
in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape
accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.

A feminist",OAG

should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti
is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing
acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of
kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in
a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown
that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same
role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will
see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be
shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of
view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties,
why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to

"All those feminists who are criticising the film did not understand at all the
meaning of the film. Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or
tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed
character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption.
Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and
demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a
victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see
his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons.  
So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before
trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de
Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh.

"Doucett Black.  Your atheism is out of place in this Christian Nation in which you live.

Before wasting time dredging up the whole ‚Äúseparation of Church and State‚Äù fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:

‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù

The man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:   

The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù

This intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù 

The U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.  Their position on the topics at hand is indeed upheld by the Supreme Law of the Land, as evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"This budget is loudly saying that DEMONETIZATION was a damp squib. If concessions in taxation is given there would loss of revenue to the government. Unless there are ways to make good this loss, concessions cannot be given. Had demonetization been successful in curbing the black money, the govt. would have had extra revenue to allow concession in personal taxation. Since the concession in this score is nominal, if not negative taking inflation into account, it is written on the face of the Union Budget, 2017 that there is very little success in curbing the black money by demonetization.  On the other hand govt. needed money for several welfare schemes and definite sources to raise this money. Since independence salaried class is the most certain source of tax revenue and thus govt. decided to take it for a ride for another time. The persons who got delighted thinking that the ill gotten  wealth of the dishonest people in their neighbourhood would now be caught, are probably still not aware of it. If they are still delighted by seeing the budget analysis on TV and think that this budget is a great booster for rural and infrastructure sector here is one statistics. Last year allocation to railways was Rs.1.21 lakh crores; this year due to the so-called thrust on infrastructure the amount is 1.31 lakh crore. If this allocation is discounted for inflation the figure seems to be less than that of the last year.",OAG

When Anna is silent on Lokpal and vocal against AK, it seems Anna is in pain and anguish of his own failure and speaking against AK only because he is known and easy  accessible to him!! 
I think, Anna comments when a paid media goes out to poke him to speak against AK when some thing like political fight occurs in Delhi between Aap and BJP. Anna should look the political fighting and corruption separately before commenting to media. He should speak about Lokpal only if corruption is the only purpose of his thought and movement....",OAG

"Undeniable facts about Muslim extremism:

Direct quotes from the Quran:
1. Quran: 4/89 : ‚ÄúThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/89 ] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.  
2. Quran: 2/1 : ‚ÄúAlif, Lam, Meem.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/2/1  ] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and the Quran cannot be doubted‚Äù
3. Quran: 8/12 : ‚Äú[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, ""I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip"".‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/8/12 , https://quran.com/8/60 ] Translation: Terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam.
4. Quran: 98/6 : ‚ÄúIndeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/98/6 ] Translation: ‚ÄúPeople of the Scripture (Jews, Christian and Sabians) and Polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all vilest of creatures that deserve no mercy.‚Äù
5. Quran: 4/3  : ‚ÄúAnd if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation: ‚ÄúTwo, three, four..!!‚Äù
6. Quran: 5/51  : ‚ÄúO you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/5/51] Translation: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make Jew and Christian friends ‚Äù
7. Quran: 2/216  : ‚ÄúFighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/2/216] Translation: ‚ÄúFighting[Jihad] is Muslim‚Äôs obligation, even if you don‚Äôt want to‚Äù
8. Quran: 3/85  : ‚ÄúAnd whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers..‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/3/85] Translation: ‚ÄúIslam is the only acceptable religion‚Äù

At that time, the communications were not encrypted and both forces could intercept each others' communication. One of the Pakistani soldier also heard this conversation from his bunker. There was a sign near the bunker which read ""Lahore - 14 Miles"". He got out from the bunker, took the sign and moved towards the advancing Indian troops for some yards and posted a modified sign there. It now read ""Lahore - 14.2 Bloody Miles ...

"Pigeral : If you have problems with Muslim Azan then you must have problem with Hindu Aarti too. Both cause noise pollution. 

Agniveer : There is difference.

1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Hindu Aarti in temples? Zero. 

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Azan in mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within 5 km radius of a mosque). 

Zero vs 365 settles everything. 

Even if Aarti loudspeaker in your locality starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try doing it with a Moulvi in a mosque and see if you come back in single piece. 

Pigeral : Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Don't they make noise? Stop them. 

Agniveer : How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come? 

Pigeral : At least 10 days. 

Agniveer : And how many times does Azan happen on loudspeaker in a year? 

Pigeral : 

Agniveer : Why silent? Let me help you. 365*5 = 1825. And then in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions etc on Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram etc. 

So it is 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 same? 

Pigeral : Wrong is wrong. There is no bigger or smaller wrong. 

Agniveer : Ok then, your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to shape before commenting on our concerns on Azan. 

Pigeral : How can you compare my personal fitness issue with an issue of 20% minorities? 

Agniveer : Same way as you compared 10 with 1825+. 

Pigeral : 

Agniveer : Why silent? 

Pigeral : Look, you can't interfere in others' religion. India is multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights. 

Agniveer : Equal rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is jailed for doing same. Where are equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal rights of noise. And you don't care about plight of 10 crore Muslim women? 

Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will get equal rights. You act as some special hero, your a$$ will be kicked. 

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is strong correlation between density of Azan and terror. Find out the places on earth where 

1. Azan is maximum (lets call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (lets call it Place 2)

Then find out how many world's top terrorists/terror organisations do Place 1 group and Place 2 group produce. That is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and which is harmless. 

Pigeral : 

Agniveer : Why silent? 

Pigeral : Who are you man? 

Agniveer : A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshipper. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

"THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF 1984

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE NARODA PATIYA CASE IN THE ANTI MUSLIM GUJARAT RIOTS OF 2002 IS A WELCOME ONE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE I984 SIKH GENOCIDE WHICH HAPPENED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER INDIRA GANDHI BY HER 2 SIKH BODYGUARDS IN RETALIATION FOR OPERATION BLUESTAR, JUSTICE IS YET TO BE DELIVERED. Though Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I don't feel she has done anything Great to be on this list. We Sikhs don't hold her in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL HER A GREAT INDIAN WHEN SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNACCOUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab & is responsible for the rise of Religious Extremism in the state AS PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered all over India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from 31st October till 4th November 1984 in a cold blooded Genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, women were gang raped & their property was set on fire. The mobs were laughing as they were killing the Sikhs. The goons were led by local Congress MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to aid them in finding Sikh houses & properties & were exhorting non Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress MPs even gave the rioters money telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the greatest amount apart from other incentives. From Oct 31 till Nov 3, blood curdling cries of ‚ÄúKHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE ‚Äì WE WILL AVENGE BLOOD WITH BLOOD‚Äù were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan & even the renowned actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan was instigating the people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the Centre at the time of the Riots, & P.V.Narasimha Rao was the Home Minister, but he did nothing till Nov 2 despite knowing about the carnage & the Delhi Police just stood as mute spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs & let the bloody carnage to continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the Senior Police Officers deliberately went on leave from Nov 1 to 3 as directed by their political masters.The Army was deliberately not called & were only told to come on the evening of Nov 2, but still there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then on Nov 3, after their quench for blood was satisfied, as if by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold blooded genocide directed out by the senior Congress politicians against the Sikhs. Had prompt action been taken on the first day of rioting, this Genocide would have never taken place. IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT STILL THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED NOR ANY PROPER LEGAL CONVICTION TAKEN AGAINST EVEN A SINGLE PERSON UNLIKE THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN THE 2002 POST GODHRA RIOTS WHICH HAPPENED MUCH LATER DESPITE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE VICTIM‚ÄôS FAMILIES.
The killers & murderers are roaming scot free & some are even ministers in the ruling Congress Govt. NEITHER ANY PROPER COMPENSATION BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR HAS ANY PROPER APOLOGY BEEN GIVEN OR ANY MEMORIAL CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK, I WON‚ÄôT BE SURPRISED IF THIS CARNAGE IS AGAIN REPEATED. THE CONGRESS GOVT IS STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT THIS BLOODY CARNAGE AS MANY OF THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE & APART FROM ISSUING HALF HEARTED APOLOGIES WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT TO THEM, THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL. THEY ARE HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT BY LIVING IN DENIAL, THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE FORGET THIS TROUBLED PHASE OF HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE GROSSLY WRONG AS HISTORY NEVER FORGETS ITSELF. UNLESS THE GUILTY ARE NOT BROUGHT TO BOOK, IT WILL LEAD TO A VERY FRUSTRATED & ANGRY GENERATION PRONE TO DRUGS & VIOLENCE.",OAG

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",OAG

"My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

"Top 10 tricks played by the media to control the masses: 

1. Project 'everything is fine' in default mode- even if they are not - thus lulling sheople into complacency. ( buffer routine 'news', sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc. ). This technique is used by shepherds rearing sheep for slaughter.

2. Emphasise individual identity (nationality, religion, state etc.), to ensure subconscious separation ( the divide and rule policy ). 

3. Contrive 'voice of the poor' / 'protest power' etc., though these do not exist. This deludes people to 'think' they are in control. 

4. Stage events ( 'astro turfing', 'shills', 'fake witnesses', 'crisis actors' etc. ), to either fabricate 'mass movement', create paranoia or extreme fear, or distract masses from real issues.

5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip etc., to divert from real issues ( and shape public opinion ).

6. Play key supporting role for big sponsored false flag events, hoaxes, etc. ( for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favourite news anchors and journalists are in fact establishment ( intelligence ) officers.

7. Portray government as victim of crime ( cheating, assault, etc. ), so that the sheople would not later protest draconian laws against themselves.

8. Manufacture extreme fear, through exaggerated claims of disease, enemy power, terrorism, etc., ( to support wars, desensitise or divide people, for example ) 

9. 'Media black out', ( non reporting leads to ignorance or dumbing down ), or reporting with malevolence, ( stereotyping or demonisation ) - the most common control technique. 

10. Lastly, and most secretive, the media is owned by a handful of corporations and suppresses other sources of information. Media forms  the 'matrix' - a web of illusions to deceive the masses, and along with 'politics' are both secretly owned by banking families. 

Next time your favourite news media 'breaks news', ask yourself: ""Is this true, or is this their latest shill / hoax / false flag operation""?",OAG

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"The Sikhs are a very peace loving community & don‚Äôt seek criminal retribution against anyone. Our Gurus have taught us to help other people in need irrespective of their caste or creed. During the days of the Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect the Hindu families & their women from the Muslims. All that they want from the Govt is that a proper & unbiased legal action be taken against the accused in order to infuse some sense of hope into the victims‚Äô families of which they have been deprived for so many years. The Govt also has to provide adequate money & resettlement options for many of the victims‚Äô families who lost their breadwinners in the Genocide & are still living in urban ghettos.

THIS INCIDENT HAS REALLY SHAKEN THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT & MANY OF THE AFFECTED FAMILIES HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I distinctly remember those fateful days as I was studying in school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like being a member of a Minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi & adjoining areas of the Hindi speaking Cow belt, Sikhs are subjected to racist taunts, humiliated & made fun of them due to their unique identity. Even I was subjected to these humiliating taunts during my school days in Delhi.

Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the Partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have any doubts.

It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between Nov 1-3 1984 following Indira's death no justice has been delivered either to the victims of this heinous GENOCIDE nor any of its perpetrators (mostly local Congress MLAs & their Goons) have been tried or brought to book. According to the BBC, early 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight all over India within 4 days & the State Police (like the Delhi Police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANSING. They merely stood there like mute spectators watching the grisly spectacle being enacted & at some instances, even colluding with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large scale murder within such a short span of time without the connivance of local Congress MLAs (or maybe even Senior Congress leaders) who, like in DELHI & elsewhere, incited the mobs with Vitriolic speeches to kill every Sikh & gave their Goons the voters' lists to aid them in tracking down Sikh Homes, freely offered money, distributed arms & offered financial rewards to their Goons to kill the Sikhs as most of these Murderers were illiterate. THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, killed with Iron rods, & their women were taken & raped & their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh Community it was like another HOLOCAUST. More casualties happened in CONGRESS ruled states (obviously).The State Police became deaf to the repeated pleas by the affected Sikh families for protection as the irate mobs continued their grisly act in on one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities were wiped out. There are photos of people laughing as they were beating the Sikhs to death. 

I was 13 years old in Delhi when this carnage took place. I have very vivid & painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but luckily we were safe as our residence was in the Delhi Cantonment which was a secure area. Had I been in an insecure area, I would have met the same fate. My Father picked up me & my Sister from our School bus on Oct 31, 1984 as we had to walk a slight distance to our house. I remember the entire city being under curfew, between Nov 1-4, 1984 & I did not go to school for a month. An eerie silence of Death was pervading over the entire city. For the first time I felt being someone from the Minority community who is living in a country being ruled by the Majority community. I remember seeing black fumes coming from nearby Janakpuri on Nov 1. We had to install Security guards outside our house for a month before things calmed down though we too got threatening phone calls that a mob is coming to our house too to kill us. 

The Government has only adopted delaying tactics till now (even 27 years after the carnage) by forming committees after committees to probe into this MASS GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimonies from the Victims' families in Court whose near & dear ones where killed in these riots, but sadly, JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED EVEN TILL NOW & the perpetrators & their goons are still roaming scot free. It is obvious the Government is trying to shield them & some Big names are also involved.

I feel the Sikh Community should file a case in the International Criminal Court at The Hague as the Indian Govt has failed to deliver justice to the affected families & till the present Govt is there, no justice will be delivered. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. Till the Indian Govt delivers prompt & effective justice to the victims of 1984 Anti Sikh Pogroms, I won't be surprised if this carnage is again repeated & it will remain as a DARK CHAPTER IN INDIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.",OAG

"The complaint that airtel is playing fool with customer: I had gone for plan change on my postpaid number 9789693896. I registered through the website.

Again nothing was received as confirmation or whatsoever. Suddenly an hour back I received a call from chennai saying that the plan change has not taken place and I was advised to contact the call center. When informed to the call center none were capable of doing anything the call was transferred to the manager and he repeated whatever the earlier fellows was saying that was ultimately of no use.
If I change plan all the benefits like free internet package offers that was there will be removed. That is the only contention and they refuse take up the request of the plan change in between such that it takes effect on from next billing cycle. but earlier it was done for withdrawing a package but it had an effect on next billing cycle.
Every time they create problem and we have to suffer. Call center or the voice support is simply useless as we have to spend our valuable time listening to their nonsense blah...blah and repeated automated messages.

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

All yogi takes about is retaliation if something happens to his people and I don't anything is wrong with it.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

IF  THE  CONCERNED STATION SUB-INSPECTOR  OR CIRCLE INSPECTOR  ARE  INFLUENCED  OR BRIBED  BY MONEY  OR  GIFTS  OR BY  POLITICAL  PRESSURE, IT IS  CHILD'S PLAY  FOR THEM  TO  FILE  A  DISTORTED  AND  MIS-LEADING  ""FIR"" AND TO  DESTROY  THE  MAIN PIECES  OF EVIDENCE  RELEVANT  TO  THE  CASE

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",OAG

"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil.",OAG

The Hamoodur Rahman Commission set up by the Pakistani government following the war noted various atrocities committed by the Pakistani military, including widespread arson and killings in the countryside, killing of intellectuals and professionals, killing of Bengali military officers and soldiers on the pretence of mutiny, killing Bengali civilian officials, businessmen and industrialists, raping numerous Bengali women as a deliberate act of revenge, retaliation and torture, deliberate killing of members of the Bengali Hindu minority and the creation of mass graves.[200] The Hamoodur Rahman Commission wrote, ""indiscriminate killing and looting could only serve the cause of the enemies of Pakistan. In the harshness, we lost the support of the silent majority of the people of East Pakistan.... The Comilla Cantonment massacre (on 27th/28th of March, 1971) under the orders of CO 53 Field Regiment, Lt. Gen. Yakub Malik, in which 17 Bengali Officers and 915 men were just slain by a flick of one Officer's fingers should suffice as an example"".

Second , I have heard from many non muslims saying Muslims are supposed to kill Non muslims where ever they find them though this is a mis understanding which I want to clear here; A verse in Quran was revealed during a war at the time of Prophet Mohammad in which the Muslims were ordered to kill the enemies but do not make any harm to children's and women who could possibly be there for some reason ' It is also mentioned at several places not to initiate a war before they start harming you Plus this verse was revealed only for that particular period of time . There is no verse in Quran which restricts a Muslim to be friend of non muslims or kill any person who is not a muslim. These are all rumors and mis understanding which makes some people sick and they start playing hatred games.

"Pigeral : If you have problems with Muslim Azan then you must have problem with Hindu Aarti too. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer : There is difference.

1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Hindu Aarti in temples? Zero.

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Azan in mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within 5 km radius of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 settles everything.

Even if Aarti loudspeaker in your locality starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try doing it with a Moulvi in a mosque and see if you come back in single piece.

Pigeral : Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Don't they make noise? Stop them.

Agniveer : How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral : At least 10 days.

Agniveer : And how many times does Azan happen on loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent? Let me help you. 365*5 = 1825. And then in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions etc on Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram etc.

So it is 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 same?

Pigeral : Wrong is wrong. There is no bigger or smaller wrong.

Agniveer : Ok then, your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to shape before commenting on our concerns on Azan.

Pigeral : How can you compare my personal fitness issue with an issue of 20% minorities?

Agniveer : Same way as you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent?

Pigeral : Look, you can't interfere in others' religion. India is multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniveer : Equal rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is jailed for doing same. Where are equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal rights of noise. And you don't care about plight of 10 crore Muslim women?

Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will get equal rights. You act as some special hero, your a$$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is strong correlation between density of Azan and terror. Find out the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (lets call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (lets call it Place 2)

Then find out how many world's top terrorists/terror organisations do Place 1 group and Place 2 group produce.

That is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and which is harmless.

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent?

Pigeral : Who are you man?

Agniveer : A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshipper. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù, 
‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù 

‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",OAG

"Hindus with full support from their religious scriptures, especially 'MANUSMRITI' has inflicted horrific torture on their Womenfolk & untouchable Dalits, since ages ... To promote the child-rape, baby-girls used to be married off to aged Hindu males, even before puberty ... Polygamy was practiced by most of the Hindu males, especially Brahmins, like Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys etc. ... With religion by their side, some of them used to marry more than 100 Hindu-women, even at the death-bed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the just-married baby-girls used to be made 'SATI' by throwing her on the pyre of her husband ... 
A bengali film named 'Antarjali Jatra', under the direction of famous director Goutam Ghose was released in 1987. This movie chronicles the evil practices prevalent in Kulin Brahminism like polygamy & ... 'SATI practice', wherein a recently widowed woman would be immolated on her husband's funeral pyre.

All sorts of restrictions used to be imposed on WIDOWS ... on 'food intake', 're-marriage of teenage widows', 'right to property', 'social status', 'recreations' et al, whereas no restriction on any kind used to be imposed on WIDOWERS !
Now-a-days, Hindus are seen mocking at the 'Burqa' used by Muslims ... But ask any Hindu, why the hell they keep their wives-mothers-grandma under the ""GHUNGHAT"" or compell their Women- folk to use vermilion (SINDOOR/BINDI), when the married hindu-men use none ... They would become speechless ! 

Let alone the commoner, even the Goddess Sita had to appear for a fire-test to prove his 'purity', she was abandoned by Hindu-God Ramchandra when she was pregnant & forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. Finally, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way Lord Krishna never married to 'Radha' & abandoned her & never met her again, after leaving Mathura for Dwarka ! Though he had 16,100 junior wives, besides 8 Principal queens ! 

Do you have the guts to name a single Hindu whose Great grand-ma / Grand-ma was not raped by his G. grand-pa / grand-pa when she was just a kid & made her to produce children like a rabbit !!

Finally, let me admit that I'm a devout Hindu myself ! And I'm proud of my religion as it allows me apply my brain to judge between good & bad ... to criticize all the evil customs of Hinduism without fear, shun them, change my ""DHARMA"" to suit the modern age ... AND HERE EXACTLY THE ISLAM IS LAGGING BEHIND ... No change, no scientific proof, no logic, no modification of Religious beliefs to suit the modern time-place, no criticism of age-old evil customs, no difference of opinions are permitted / practiced in ISLAM ...

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.",CAG

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly ""legal"" steps?
Answer:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party]
-> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people.
[According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account.
[No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax]
-> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white.
[Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!!
*Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process teach you about how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.",CAG

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/.../fatwa-issued-against.../

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",CAG

"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù, 
‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù 

‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù

"ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY for CHINA'S NEED OF SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM 
=======================================

Arunachal Pradesh of india, the land of rising sun, undisputed beauty queen of Nature & powerhouse of hydropowers is always been a bone of contention between India & China.

But why china is so adament to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet ? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-politics or Militaristics or Expansionist mindset of China ? Why China is playing a zero-sum game knowing fully well that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh  at any cost ? 

It is undoubtedly clear to everybody that the CORE GROWTH ENGINE of china's economy has been SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM which has two componants as LOCAL & GLOBAL features. 

It is the GLOBAL FEATURE which makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via NAGALAND as GATEWAY for china to the SHORTEST riparian transportation system based upon RIVER KALADIN of MYANMAR to the BAY of BENGAL (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar which will eventually form KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor powered by 'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH EAST of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as current global riparian transportation system takes too much times & distances to cover. That is why CHINA keeps disputing the ARUNACHAL PRADESH thereby giving much irritation to the India and preventing both powerhouses to realise full mutual prosperities.

But this ZERO-SUM game can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having RORO facility at DHUBURI & elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE , river brahmaputra can provide peaceful & sustainable riparian solution to above discussed problem and for this both India & China Government have to build following multilateral economic corridor powered by inland, road & rail networks (taking both Bangladesh & Bhutan Government on-board) , namely , ""DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING (DDTLB) ECONOMIC CORRIDOR "".",CAG

"Some of Mira's comments may stem from the judgement that full time mothers face today. Feminism is surely about choice. Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a ""puppy"".

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government....",CAG

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",CAG

Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech ""islamaphobia"" or ""muslim ban"" about those countries? Do they protest outside the embassies of those countries? I think not.

Perhaps anybody you encounter who accuses Trump of ""islamaphobia"" or a ""muslim ban"" should be made aware of those facts, mentioned above.

"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.",CAG

Yogi ji has duly been elected to head the UP government. If anyone feels that his elevation to the covetted post is wrong, he is free to seek judicial remedy. Yogi ji is going to work, like his idol, Narendra Bhai Modi, for the betterment of UP as a whole. Moreover, the parliamentary elections of 2019 are not far away.

""" ARTICLE 370 DISTURBING INDIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY ""

Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in an article that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. ( *** means Indian State Jammu & Kashmir ).

The Article in drafted in part xx1 of the constitution : temporary, Traditional  and special provision. ( **** means if Indian constitution or Indian Parliament not accept these provision then automatically Article 370 is no valve and not valid, and ready to delete from Indian constitution )

Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu the principal drafted of the Indian constitution, had refused to draft Article 370.(**** Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu said Jammu&Kashmir state is integral part of India so no need special autonomous )

Jammu & Kashmir accession to India dated 26 October 1947 since then it was Indian State. So need to delete Article 370 by Indian Constitution for better governance.

I request and say to Prime Minister of India Respected Narendra Modi please look after these Article 370 and delete immediately in our Indian Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir State people wants Business Corridor, Industrial Hub and relationship with South and North States, regarding this issues please take necessary step and co-operate.....Jai Hind

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group.......
Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .

The reply by CAs : 

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters 

- 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this) 

Balance..........
20.5 crores 

Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)

15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it.... 

.... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±

if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*

4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance 

5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..

Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... 

As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...üòä

"‚ÄúHi üôÇ My name is Gurmehar Kaur. I am from Jalandhar, India. This is my dad Capt. Mandeep Singh. He was killed in the 1999 Kargil War. I was 2 years old when he died. I have very few memories of him. I have more memories of how it feels NOT to have a father. I also remember how much I used to hate Pakistan & Pakistanis because they killed my Dad. I used to hate Muslims too because I thought all Muslims are Pakistanis. When I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha. Because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father‚Äôs death. My mother held me back and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him. It took me a while to know but today I do. I have learnt to let go of my hate. It was not easy but its not difficult. If I can do it, so can you. Today, I am a soldier too, just like my dad. I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be here. I am making this video because I want the Governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France & Germany can become friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan & USA can put their past behind and work towards progress, then why can‚Äôt we?? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the calibre of leadership of both nations. We cannot dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please pull your socks up. Talk to each other and get the job done.Enough state sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is Enough.

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",CAG

"Statistics of phone freedom251.

291rs per phone. (251+40rs shipping)
x 6L order per second
= 17.46 cr

It was taking order till 12.15pm approx
I.e 6 hrs and 15 min which is 22,500 seconds

17.46 cr per sec x 22,500 sec
= 3,92,850 cr

3,88,494 cr was turnover of reliance industries in year 2014-15

That means within 6 hrs  15min they crossed turnover of reliance

Within 6 second tax audit become applicable to that company

And if we calculate interest on the said amount per day

3,92,850 cr x 4% x 1/365 (by taking minimum interest rate)
= 43.05 cr

And if after 4 months they will say we are unable to give product and refund 291rs to everyone
43.05 cr x 120 days approx
= 5,166 cr 
They will earn within 4 months by way of interest

"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government",NAG

"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù",NAG

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

"The situation of west Bengal has become terribly communal. I am from west Bengal. We have witnessed a number of communal riots taking place where majority of Hindus were molested, beaten and muslim illegal Bangladeshi immigrants ransacked Hindus residents, shops and religious temple. Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being targeted yet. We are living under fear as mamta government providing full support to these miscreants. Local Bengali medias are not not allowed to show the current situation of west Bengal. We urge central government to look into the matter seriously or else West Bengal will soon become mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. Mumtaz Beghum government is arresting any media channel which is trying to broadcast these muslim riots where they are butchering hindus.

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. still you Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government panty GANG",NAG

Yet this community, many of them, are dissatisfied. In that case Indian govt should allow them to migrate to Pakistan Banladesh or any other. Muslim country which will take them. Those who support secularism, can also try and emigrate to other countries of their choice if they will be accepted.

"Sub:- Like of 29/11 attacks can‚Äôt be stopped without solving Kashmir problem which can‚Äôt be solved without end-game in sight. 

-----In the entire history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times than Pakistan especially India with better level of advance in science & technology as is evident from ‚ÄòMangal-yan‚Äô the Mars mission] cowardly & helplessly tolerates repeated humiliation by way of armed aggression on it. India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India‚Äôs partition is yet to be written.  

One more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‚ÄòSainik‚Äô laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‚ÄòMoksha‚Äô through ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‚ÄòSati‚Äô because their husbands got ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‚Äòmadhosh‚Äô husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land]. 

This culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‚Äòkeede-makode‚Äô (insects) and at the top of it are called ‚ÄòShaheed‚Äô (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)  

But in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‚ÄòUnited India Party‚Äô which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India. 

It is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-     

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html 

[Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]

2)Every business outlet small or big shall have swiping machines/paytm like arrangement. It must be made mandatory to run business.
3)Stop printing Rs.2000/_ immediately. And in future Rs.500/- . If not demonitize them six months before every election. All elections hence shall be conducted on the same date henceforth.
4)like indirect taxes integration, integrate all direct taxes & collect them through transaction tax from bank as arthakranti suggested. 
5) Continue cash withdrawal restrictions even after Dec 31st. 2016. Reduce cash usage eventually and limit to Rs.5000/- per month to individuals and Rs.20000/- to 100000/- to businesses as per their turnover.
6) Gst shall be collected at first billing. Stop input credit and collect turnover tax basing on turnover of distribution, service providers, and other small businesses.

"Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all used to think but he is just another corrupt politician who has worn the mask of ""Harbinger of Good days"". Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points. 
When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank...
But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I think he has cheated all of us...
Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern..
I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP?? 
Please realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at he border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM...

"Welcome Sir
Please kindly make it convenient to be spared my experiences as a Self Employed Er. Entrepreneur :
My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

"I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.

The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.

When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.

Today i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.",NAG

"Sub:- (i)- Before (Ret) High Court Judge a lady dies in Hospital due to non-availability of NEW currency (ii)- Law should be same for all. The Govt & RBI should be prosecuted for causing deaths by negligence u/s 304 A IPC etc

--- On November, 25 evening on a business TV channel ‚Äòmagic bricks NOW‚Äô one of the panelist Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha said that in his housing society at Mumbai a lady had heart problem hence her family members and neighbors [including Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha] took her to a nearest private hospital but she died because her family did not have new cash currency to meet the demand of the hospital. 

A negligent driver is prosecuted and punished for killing a person by car / truck. The organizers / management of public functions / utilities are prosecuted and punished in case of fire due to negligence in which people get killed. Similarly the authorities / officials of Government and Reserve Bank of India should also be prosecuted and punished for negligence about demonetization which has allegedly killed ~ 70 persons, as mentioned at:- 

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/Opposition-protecting-Government-and-RBI-from-prosecution-under-Section-304-A-IPC-etc_a45304.html   

It is expected that Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha will take this matter to its logical / legal end and would get justice to the victim and her family, relatives and friends by getting the GOI & RBI (and hospital authorities) prosecuted for negligence etc about illegal demonetization program which has caused this death of the lady.

It's obviously an attempt to sway the international community away from the atrocities committed by Indian Occupation Forces on Unarmed Kashmiris.

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000

SBI: 95-105

"Worst BANK... and all customer care executive including Customer Service Manager (Chairman & MD Cell) MR. RAVI M. are extremely ignorant and they are dealing customers as if they are running a grocery shop.

Just imagine.. 16th of March I received mail from him sayingDear Mr. Customer,

We acknowledge receipt of your below e-mail received at the office of the Senior Management.

The reference number for this interaction is APW-0316-862-BG. We have noted your concerns and we shall reply with the status within 4 working days.

Should you have any further concerns on the same issue, kindly write back to us using this same email ID and reference number.

We appreciate your cooperation and patience in the interim.

To me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it.

"*Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President.*

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!

"Kevin Gaskin.  You're most welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but you'll not find anything about ""separation of Church and State"" contained in any of them.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as had been done by Washington and Adams before him. The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between church and state,"" which led to the erroneous ‚Äòshort-hand‚Äô for the Establishment Clause (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.    

‚ÄúWhy do I have a freedom of religion‚Ä¶?‚Äù  The answer lay in the Congressional papers as they pertain to our Constitution as we know it today.  The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù

This intent was well understood, as evidence by court rulings after the First Amendment.  In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù 

One must realize that our Founding Fathers were striving to attain ‚Äúfreedom of religion‚Äù due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  It wasn‚Äôt only Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism.  Our Founding Fathers set about to recognize the many denominations of Christianity.  Further, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, as opposed to granting power of control by any one denomination.  Herein lay the misinterpretation of the reckless ‚Äòshorthand‚Äô known as ‚Äúseparation of Church and State.‚Äù  

A more accurate statement is likely ‚Äúseparation of denominations of the Church and State.‚Äù  Such interpretation is wholly supported by the Congressional papers in reference to the statement, ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù

As for the statement, ‚ÄúMost of our founding fathers were agnostic,‚Äù that is simply not true.  It is a blanket statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general.  Yes, there were agnostics in those days but they were not nearly so prevalent as claimed.  Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.  Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.

John Adams is another erroneously accused of being agnostic.  Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.‚Äù  I believe you‚Äôll agree his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel any claims of his agnostic beliefs.",NAG

"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, ‚ÄúIf a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô or worship, he goes to hell.‚Äù",NAG

"'vaidya shaala'/ ‡§µ‡•à‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ - THE RIGHT WORD
Certain biblical & other terms were modified by Christian Missionaries to sound as if Indian, in order to penetrate their religious activities.
'Hospital' was one among them. It was changed as 'aspataal' in North & 'aasupatri' in South. But, it is appropriate that we shall give up that pseudonym & use our native word 'vaidya shaala'/ ‡§µ‡•à‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ!
vaidya shaala/ ‡§µ‡•à‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ, davaakhaana/ ‡§¶‡§µ‡§æ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ & hospiTal/ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§ü‡§≤ are correct words.
