 I am overwhelmed by people's response! I assure them we will repay their affection with unprecedented development,0
 Concluded the campaign for 2014 Lok Sabha elections with a massive rally in Ballia in UP. I thank people for the wonderful response,0

 There is something in India's soil that makes India special. Our destined role of Jagat Guru calls. Lets create a strong & developed India!,0
 It is unfortunate that EC is not concerned about the institution's neutrality & that is why our Karyakartas have to embark on a Satyagraha,0
 Under Atal ji India scripted a new chapter in our history & gave a strong message to the world with the success of the Tests in Pokhran,0
 At the Rohaniya rally Col Nizamuddin joined us. He is over 100 years old & devoted his life to the nation by joining the Azad Hind Fauj,0

" ""As a Party President using terms like """"Unch"""" & """"Neech"""" does not suit Madam. Is the fear of defeat so much that she has to say such things?""",1
 Despite Congress efforts to bring caste & communal politics in campaign we remained focussed on our agenda of development & good governance,1
 Kerala Minister who came to meet me was reprimanded. Cong leader wanted Lata ji's Bharat Ratna taken back.This is politics of untouchability,2
 Tests of 1998 were a victory of technology & the nation's willpower. Our scientists worked very hard to develop Nuclear Programme,0
 Sharing my last year's Blog that contains portions of Atal ji's historic speech of 1998,0
 NDA's foreign policy also ensured that those nations opposed to India testing gradually developed strong ties with India in various fields,0
 From Day 1 Congress' attitude to Elections has been non-serious. They talked about everything apart from core issues & what they did in Govt,1
 If someone does politics of untouchability it is the Congress & those who made their political careers by following votebank politics,2
 Mirzapur's brass carpet & handloom industry face many problems & brick kilns are not running. What have UP Govt & Centre done about it?,1
 I am very happy that the doors of the holy Kedarnath Temple have once again opened for pilgrims. My best wishes to the pilgrims!,0
 Congress leaders can talk about everything from Modi to the Gujarat model but have they spoken a word on what they have done for Amethi?,1
 Today I was in UP & Bihar and one has to be there at the rallies to believe the enthusiasm. People are looking to NDA as a ray of hope,0
 I wish my friends in the Congress who keep abusing Gujarat would have read their own Govt's report that has lauded Gujarat's development,1
 They looted the nation in the name of the poor but now it is the son of a poor man who is challenging them. They are not able to digest that,2
 Didi wanted Bangladeshi infiltrators removed in 2005. Now due to votebank politics she supports them. People didn't expect such Poriborton!,1
 My best wishes to pilgrims from all over India as the Badrinath Temple opens today,0
 Amethi elected 3 members of 1 family over the years but what did it get? This BJP Charge Sheet tells you just that http://bjp.org/en/media-resou,1
 I went to Amethi with a message of change. For years 1 family has ruined Amethi. I went to sow seeds of a better future for Amethi,2
 We admired Didi for the way she fought the Left. People of Bengal expected Poriborton but nothing has changed in last 3 yrs only Didi has,1
 The Report lauds Guj's land Acquisition & Allocation model as a best practice that can be emulated by other states,0
 Campaign for 2014 Elections is reaching its final stages but no Congress leader has talked about development issues. Very sad,1
 Over 6 lakh weavers lost their jobs. A package of Rs 6000 cr was announced but nothing reached the weavers. Its deeply distressing,0
 Addressed rallies in Kolkata Barasat & Krishnanagar. I have received phenomenal affection from people of Bengal during the entire campaign,0
 Support NDA for a strong & stable Govt. that will bring an end to votebank politics that has divided our nation http://india272_com/2014/05/04/bha,0
 Election process has been long but people's excitement is only increasing. Direction of wind is very clear http://india272_com/2014/05/04/3d-,0
 NDA is firmly committed to creating a Skilled India breaking away from the Scam India under UPA's misrule,1
 A vote for @smritiirani is a vote for progress. She will do for Amethi in 60 months what they never did all these yrs,1
 There is no martyrdom in politics. So why should we be martyrs for the sake of SECULARISM? This time we have to vote out of confidence HOPE & self-respect not out of FEAR,0
 Selfie is in! Share yours using #SelfieWithModi & see what happens https://mosaic_narendramodi_in,0
 Offered prayers at the Tirumala Temple. I prayed to Lord Venkateswara for the peace & prosperity of our nation,0
 Congrats to people for joining the festival of democracy in large numbers. Its gladdening to see first time voters voting in large numbers,0
 India is one. NDA will not work for Hindus or Muslims but for realising the dreams of the people of India http://nm4_in/1i16uZr,0
 I apologize to people of Gujarat. During the entire campaign I spent only 18 hours campaigning in the state,0
 Cong is only bothered about power & the chair. A Mother's love is understandable but not at the cost of the nation & people's aspirations,1
 If Cong thinks they can survive by repeating false promises they are mistaken. People of India have called Cong's bluff & will punish it,1
 2014 polls are about Seemandhra's future. They have to choose between Seemandhra & Scam Andhra. One wrong choice can impact people's future,0
 In Tirupati urged people of Seemandhra to bless NDA with a resounding majority in the State Assembly & elect all NDA MPs to Lok Sabha,0
 Congress SP & BSP are fighting for the chair while we are fighting for your happiness. Divide & rule is their way unite & progress is ours,1
 Had UPA integrated rivers Seemandhra's farmers would not have suffered. We will fulfil Atal ji's dream of river linking & help farmers,1
 After 10 years of misgovernance & a certain defeat in 2014 Congress now wants instability which is the last thing India needs today,2
 PM may have spoken even 1100 times but did he ever talk about how Sonia ji's NAC not Planning Commission mattered more in decision making?,1
 NDA will devote special attention to Seemandhra's coastline & focus on ports that will become the gateway to India & Seemandhra's progress,0
 Congress' appetite for corruption is legendary! From the earth seas till the skies they spared nothing! UP will not accept this any longer,2
 Cong got Lalu ji released from jail but top Cong leaders are avoiding sharing stage with him in rallies. People can see through these games,1
 2014 polls are a choice between those who want a Scam India & NDA which is working hard to create a Skilled India,1
 Never imagined such a remarkable response to #SelfieWithModi. A big thanks. Here are some Tweets shared by friends http://nm4_in/1rEihOe,0
 While I was speaking I could see large number of people gathered at the various locations. I derive lot of strength from their enthusiasm,0
 Addressed 3D rallies in over 100 places across India. After this round I have addressed 900 3D rallies in the last few weeks,0
 Joined Bharat Vijay Rallies in Khalilabad Basti Gonda & Balrampur. Despite the scorching heat the rallies witnessed record attendance!,0
 We are witnessing a phenomenal response to NDA rallies. People have seen through Congress that has always insulted people from this land,1
 Under @ncbn Hyderabad became globally known for Software industry. The same way NDA is committing to make Seemandhra a Hardware Capital,0
 India needs a strong Government. Modi does not matter. I can go back & open a tea stall. But the nation can't suffer anymore,0
" ""Rahul Baba says """"27000 crore posts are vacant"""" & """"2 out of 1"""" children are malnourished in Guj. Only he can explain how this can happen""",1
 By the time campaigning ends I would have addressed 475 mega rallies including 196 Bharat Vijay Rallies across every part of India,0
 We are secular not because the word was added in our Constitution. Secularism is in our blood. We believe in Sarva Pantha Sambhava,0
 Who is Mr. Chidambaram trying to protect in Sharda Chit Fund Scam? NDA assures total investigation into the scam where people were cheated,1
 There is no question of insulting our martyrs who give everything to the nation. I would rather quit politics than insult our martyrs,1
 Due to communal politics of Abdullah family Kashmiri Pandits were removed from their homes only due to their religion. Is this secularism?,2
" ""Subhas Babu said """"Give me blood I will give you freedom."""" I told people """"Give us support we will give Surajya""""""",0
 Just for the sake of politics Dr Abdullah's family communalised J&K which is a land of Sufism and harmony http://nm4_in/1iuCZ2M,2
 By the end of the campaign I would have addressed 1350 3D rallies & joined Chai Pe Charcha that was held across 4000 locations,0
 Successive Govts ignored jute industry but NDA is firm on reviving the industry just like we revived the textile sector in Gujarat,0
 India has lost all hope from UPA which can neither inspire nor fulfil aspirations of the youth. UPA's sole aim is to save their chairs,1
 Mamata Didi is more concerned about her chair than people. She has to realize that she is in power now time of Andolans are long over,1
 Dr Abdullah's recent statements were hilarious. He showcased his ignorance & tried to hide how his family ruined J&K http://nm4_in/1iuCZ2M,1
 Congress Ministers from UP are more concerned about appearing on TV even if it means making illogical statements instead of serving people,1
 Many friends are asking me about the nature & extent of the campaign so far. They want to know how many rallies I have addressed so far,0
 The way Rahul Baba is making statements with a dash of comedy in them I think the TV show of Kapil Sharma may soon have to shut shop,1
 People from Bihar Odisha & Marwaris are not welcome for Mamata Didi but those from Bangladesh are. Time to stop such votebank politics,1
 Congress says a tsunami destroys & Modi talks of tsunami. Yes this is a Tsunami that will destroy corruption price rise & misgovernance,0
 My coming to Varanasi is like a child going to his Mother. I have come to this divine land on the call of Ganga Mata,0
 'Jod-tod' politics has ruined our nation. Time has come to vote for a stable Govt that is not dependent on unhealthy politics,1
 Fear of defeat is visible on Congress & that is why Cong is spreading lies. Madam came to Gujarat but even in land of Bapu she spread lies,1
 A leader talking about women empowerment has failed to build facilities to educate girls in his own constituency! What can be more ironical,1
" ""Its a pity some minds can't see beyond balloons & toffees. Today their own Govt has given what they call """"toffee"""" yet another trophy!""",1
 My message of self assessment & self reliance for nationalist voters and BJP supporters,0
 UP & Benaras have great potential in tourism but the Samajwadi Party Govt chose to market itself than tourism sector causing damage to UP,1
 When my party’s rule will come this wrong impression will vanish from the mind of our Muslim brothers. Will treat all citizens equally,0
 I am ruthless when it comes to implementing BJP strategy (excerpts from my @ibnlive interview),0
 Both the BSP and the BJP have given 17 Dalits tickets in UP. So how is Mayawati ji a champion of Dalits?,1
 But Now: Mayawati ji ka base khisak raha hai. This is happening for the first time since Kanshi Ram ji in UP:  http://tinyurl_com/k2lvzt9,1
 Whenever the Chinese soldiers want they come and have picnic inside our territory and our government could do nothing,1
 Will 'PM' Rahul always seek mummy Sonia's advice?,1
 If BJP is voted to power welfare of people belonging to all religions will be kept in mind,0
 Is Ram-Rajya a communal term? Disowning our culture to look secular? Is quoting from Tulsidas communal? Such a travesty of tradition!,1
 Fire in PMO. 45 files vanished in MOEF. CBI closing cases in apparent hurry. Revenge appointments. UPA showing 'scorched earth' nervousness,1
 Such fertile land of Bihar left barren due to poor cultivation. Pity they just focussed on cultivating castes there,1
 Mamata didi you talked about the Flower Power in your book. You're right Didi. That flower is the Lotus,0
 I feel sad at the tragedy of Shri Nitish Kumarji. He failed to gauge the mood of the nation for the lure of an elusive vote-bank,1
 In Bihar. East & West Champaran. The land of first resistance against injustice. The crowds keen to revolt again,0
 It is only ironic that on the Press Freedom Day we saw UPA's shameless manipulation of DD by censoring parts of Modiji's interview,1
 Overwhelming response of people even in the interiors of West Bengal today in my rallies prove that change is imminent,0
 Collecting voter slips back not allowing rally & arresting party workers whatever returning officer does congress is not returning back,1
 Congress which couldn't tolerate 2nd term of Subhash C Bose is carrying the weight of Soniaji since 16 years as President. What a comedown,1
 In the case of BJP even intention is worthy of raid. In the case of Rahul commission of wrongdoing is open but eyes and mouths are shut,1
 He will kill 22000 will abolish NREGA nullify food security. NO control on present Rahul baba derives satisfaction in being astro-baba,1
 Manish Tewari says he keeps Prasar Bharti at arm's length. Oh really dear. Stretch thy arm no further than thy sleeve will hide,1
 But the game is not yet over. No room for complacency till the last vote is cast and counted,0
 The problem with Prasar Bharti is not Manish Tewari's arm's length. It is that he gives no elbow room to Prasar Bharti,1
 Have these people cared to read the definition of Ram-Rajya given by Tulsidas? It is all-inclusive,0
 They knew they are losing ground so they got into denial of ground to Modiji's rally in Kashi. Real groundbreaking act Mr RO!,1
 When Sonia Gandhi accuses Modiji of using money in campaigning I wonder she does it on her own as they say she being sixth richest,1
 BJP's campaign is a sum of high planning sincere effort intelligent direction skillful execution and strong leadership,0
 From abuse to excuse bar is further lowered by the embittered antagonists to meet the challenge posed by Lotus force,1
 As (if) he has no future of his own Rahul baba talks only of what Modiji will do,1
 21st century belongs to India. Enough of dynastyism casteism and sectarianism,0
" ""Truth had been killed for honour. And Plato said for nothing that """"You should not honour men more than the truth.""""""",1
 Need we or can we make elections so alienating so estranging so divorced from the cultural ethos?,1
 Modiji comes from a state where Gandhiji started making use of cultural terms to make the freedom movement mass-based. Can we disown that?,0
 RO is only reflecting the pique and peeve of @narendramodi Ji's rivals. EC's helplessness is reflecting the same of the adversaries,1
 Times I search for words and they are just not there. Killings in Assam is one such occasion. Violence is not the solution certainly not,0
 Interesting acrobatics. Disallowed then promised to think a week after. Making laughing stock of an institution? Happy World Laughter Day,1
 Food Security/NREGA is expediency for Congress. For us cultivated in the philosophy of daridra-narayan & antyodaya is an article of faith,1
 That is why our states like Chattisgarh and MP provide better prototypes of food security,0
 Of course we will revisit these schemes so that poor are served better. Administrative imagination did not end with the coinage of the two,0
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay have been our inspirer in these matters. We don't just say God's heart is for poor. We find God in heart of the poor,0
 Inadequacies in these schemes are manifest. Congress does not have the will make these schemes better,1
 Rahul says he will kill thousands. Farukh says murderer. Derek says butcher. But ECI does not say a word. A tragedy of speech & silence,2
 Of the 36 ways of Chinese fighting to run away is considered the best. Don't you believe? Ask AK,1
 Can a spontaneous encircling of a VIP by the media be termed as a Press Conference? Lexicon will die of exhaustion,1
 The truth will out. Modi ji never said Dawood is in Pakistan but the guilty mind could not stop spilling the beans itself,1
 If a political celebrity comes out of the booth and is surrounded by enthusiasts will it be called a meeting? Did he organize it?,1
 After Soniaji AK49 invoked God. It's not for nothing his is a B-team. Watch her footsteps you can safely say which way he'll go tomorrow,1
 I wholly agree with the view of ex-CEC Mr T S Krishnamurthy. By no stretch of imagination it can be termed as campaigning or canvassing,0
 Why One is singled out for a violation done by all & sundry? Persons in similar circumstances are not receiving similar treatment Umpireji,1
 Being abusive is indicative of not only an uncultivated mentality but also of a defeated and an utterly frustrated mind,1
 Selective prosecution is a violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of law. It is a denial of justice,1
 To end terror is our national duty. Modi ji just referred to the obligation of the Indian mandate and they started squirming in Pakistan,1
 We are closer to Kashmir than your jugular vein Mr. Sharif. Interfere in our internal matters & have jugular vein compression syndrome,2
 After this Municipal & Panchayat elections will come. Again Achaar Sanhita. Can a developing nation afford this long & arid regime of MCCs?,0
 Chidambaram accuses MP & Gujarat of not allowing GST to materialize. Right we're proud of it. It would have been disaster in present form,1
 I knew that anti-Modi forces are under severe stress seeing the defeat looming large. Now revealing their true colours,1
 Those barons who think power is their birthright one day get axed out. Happy Parshuram Jayanti,1
 He is taking on against so many Maharathis. Will not be an Abhimanyu repeat this time. Bharat has learnt from Mahabharat,1
 This dear friends I say on today's auspicious day. The day when Vedvyas & Lord Ganesh started writing Mahabharat. Happy Akshay Tritya,0
 Even when the voting got over in my state rigours of a stringent Code continues. Rigours that you do not see even in a developed country,1
 Time to think whether we need to have a negativistic and anti-development nature of Model Code of Conduct in operation for so long,0
 Politics of vendetta allowed but naming national security head barred. They say they're monitoring quality of politics in electoral times,1
 How does UPA think of increasing the tax burden on goods of common use like cloths tea edible oil cycles etc and reducing it on luxuries?,1
 We are still being told not to call field officers even for development review purposes. Can you afford such a hard-nosed anti-growth bias?,0
 Democracy is for development and not at the cost of development. People cannot be asked to wait till this grand show is over,1
 GST cannot be a devious way of making states financial slaves of Centre. States are not subordinate to Centre. They are federation partners,0
 Basic human and constitutional rights that constitute the foundation for representative government derive their force not from the EC,0
 How come they impose their appreciation of facts on local authorities making it a mechanical enforced and coloured exercise of power?,1
 An overly formal and heavy-handed execution of MCC may be self-defeating. What justifies ban on issuing work tenders now?,0
 How can they be so disrespectful to the constitutional duty of a democratically mandated government in such a crisis?,1
 Unlike others mission of Indians isn't sponsored by state or institution. It is their brilliance & hard work that make them count anywhere,0
 Indians everywhere are contributing in rebuilding the world. That Mission and Commission of 'Vasudhev Kutumbakam' continues,0
 US President Obama worried over the violence in his country against Hindus Muslims and Sikhs. Any consternation out there in ruling UPA?,1
 Millions thronging the streets of Varanasi. Those who get the certificate from TIME should see what the city of The Timeless is hinting at,0
 Difference between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. Modi ji has something to say and Rahul Gandhi has to say something,1
 So first mother tires out then son huffs and puffs handing over the baton to sister. A relay race competing against one working tirelessly,1
 Each and every denial of an authentic Modi wave creates further ripples in the minds of people making it stronger,0
 Is sending someone to Pakistan more derogatory than throwing someone in ocean or in a ditch? Certain silences are more eloquent,1
 Manmohan ji in Govt & Sonia ji in politics read out their speeches. Why? Because if they speak their mind they would be speechless,1
 Why did Congress develop a mortal fear of Gujarat. The state had always been a game-changer for the country. Dandi. Sampoorna Kranti & now,0
 PM Manmohan ji was in office but not in power. Sonia ji and Rahul had authority but no responsibility and no vision,1
 Unique elections in the history of Indian democracy. Centre stage is overwhelmingly occupied by prime ministerial candidate in opposition,0
 They say UPA1 is better than UPA2. But UPA1 was the period when major scams took place UPA2 was shameless defence of their public exposure,2
 Some people talked of intellectual arrogance of a trio in UPA I disagree in fact they humbly allowed being dictated by a 10th pass,1
 Hindus and Muslims both face hunger poverty corruption inflation lack of immunisation etc. They are one because their problems are one,0
 PM Dr Manmohan Singh should have been known for his great knowledge of economics unfortunately he is known by the company he keeps,1
 So Rahul Gandhi changed his political narrative saying 'Chowkidar bhi kabhi kabhi chori kar leta hai'. This much concession for The Family,1
 Marital is becoming martial. No one cares who marries whom but when marital status starts subverting and milking the system people react,1
 Ever saw them marching with multitude of this proportion? In a wasteland of seclusion smug about screen presence Modi-baiters losing pulse,1
 India has been ranked a lowly 94 among 177 countries of the world on the Worldwide Corruption Perception Index 2013 no debate?,0
 INDIA is home to a quarter of world's hungry. In august company of  Ethiopia Congo Chad and Niger. Any time now left to discuss them?,0
 In Global Hunger Index report 2013 India is put in the alarming category worse than Rwanda Pakistan & Bangladesh. Anyone debating on it?,0
 Modi wave didn't ensue off BJP. It emerged out of the necessity of Congress to deflect discussion on its dismal & abject non-performance,1
 For the first time those in power have been so visibly dwarfed and over-topped by the mind-blowing presence of a leader in opposition,1
 They allowed levels of inflation to be oppressive & back-breaking and they accuse us of crony capitalism,2
 Show up and Vote. Not only for expressing the right to vote but for expressing your will to live in dignity in a country you make proud,0
 PM says he spoke a thousand times. Blamed it on media fact is that his words were lost as they were mimed comatose & emulated lifelessly,1
 There are elements who want to exploit fear psychosis and for this they need to create & deepen it. They're out with their barbs against us,2
 Otherwise tell me what did Congress do for coolies and tendu leaf pluckers in the last ten years at the behest of Rahul Gandhi,1
 Will address rally in Lucknow today and engage with voters through 'Maha Janasampark Abhiyan',0
 People have had enough of unethical compromises and compulsions. Now they want to see politics of commitment. Therefore vote for change,0
 Vote for one who exerts power for national interest does not shun responsibilities whose authority is writ large on the hearts of people,0
 He was an echo of 'The Family' not only in deeds but also in words. His mimesis has become a nemesis for the people,1
 This may be the beginning of a new politics. Indians have seen excess of politics of pressure,0
 India wants to see a politics of purpose as epitomized by our Prime Ministerial candidate Shri @narendramodi,0
 Friends hangout with me on G+ tomorrow at 7 pm. To participate submit your questions here: http://google_co_in/elections/ed/i,0
 UPA may use dirty tricks to delay Modi Ji's plane but they cannot stop his victory run. EC must enquire into this incident and take action,1
 The moot question for today is that can someone in the name of expressing his opinion appeal voters to cast en-masse vote on religious lines,0
 Sonia Ji's meeting with Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid is a clear indication of Congress mentality which treats minorities only as a votebank,1
 Rahul Gandhi talks of a regime of rights but declined giving any right to their Prime Minister,1
 Who is honest and who is corrupt who is efficient and who is callous who delivers and who makes only false promises Is it not apparent,0
 Remembering Shaheed Mangal Pandey India's first independence warrior on his martyrdom day,0
 When Rahul Gandhi tore the copy of Ordinance he actually tore the institution of Prime Minister of India,1
 There are reasons to believe that Manmohan Singh was not by nature silent he was asked to keep mum,1
 Remembering martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Let's not forget the supreme sacrifice of innocent Indians on this day,0
