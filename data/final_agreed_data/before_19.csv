Modi Govt changed the law to allow Electoral Bonds so that Corporates who were allowed to Loot & Scoot could return the favour by donating anonymously to BJP. Even EC criticized the scheme saying it has serious impact on Transparency. Cartoon Courtesy: @CartoonistSan,OAG
Shocking! The entire country wanted #Abhinandan back & Modi is resentful of that. Modi wants to use our Military Men merely as cannon fodder without any concern for their safety,OAG
Banning of all illegal private armies and vigilante groups and law against lynching. #CPIMManifesto,NAG
When political leaders fail to create real jobs in a real economy they give handouts to the poor. This has always been the Congress way and the latest promise of a basic minimum income fits the pattern,OAG
Rahul Gandhi's grandmother won magnificently in the 1971 general election on the slogan of 'ghareebi hatao'. If poverty still needs a 'surgical strike' fifty years later should Rahul not be asking why?,CAG
I just met Pehlu Khan's family and their story made me ashamed for India. They are unable to get justice because they got attacked on their way to court. And not even the new Congress government in Rajasthan has offered any help,CAG
Do you believe that the Indian justice system is so corrupted by politicians that major decisions can be influenced? Why then do you still practice law?,CAG
Think how India would be transformed if this 3.6 lakh Crores was spent on improving abysmal rural schools hospitals roads and sanitation. Why does the Congress Party always resort to dole??,CAG
Sam Pitroda would have done well to think before speaking about 26/11. If he had he would have known that the attack was not the work of '8-10' random Pakistanis. They were pawns of the Pakistani military in an act of war,CAG
Mamata Banerjee wants to become prime minister as is clear from the national level issues in her manifesto. If she does she will revive the Planning Commission. She seems more Marxist than the Marxists she ousted!,CAG
Great that Nirav Modi has been arrested and may even be extradited. But why do we hear not a single political leader ask that his conspirators in public sector banks be punished? Or even publicly named and shamed? They are already in India and as culpable,CAG
Those who talk of the 'institutional collapse' under Modi need to visit a small town police station and courthouse. I just did. So trust me when I tell you these vital cogs in the justice system collapsed long long ago,CAG
And the sad thing is that there are many fine economists in the Congress Party who know that 'gharibi' only ends when people living in poverty get the tools to remove it. Education healthcare jobs,CAG
The worst thing about election travels is confronting the horrible reality that it is going to be decades before Indian towns stop resembling vast garbage dumps,CAG
The one who needs to leave this country is you if you are proud that Pehlu Khan was brutally killed by cow vigilantes. And if you are proud that his family cannot even get justice,OAG
Not true. I said thousands of villages were now Open Defecation Free. This is a huge achievement. In 2014 rural sanitation covered less than 40% of Indian villages. It is now more than 90%. This is because of the Swachch Bharat programme,NAG
Why is India silent on Balochistan? What is happening there is much much worse than anything that has happened in Kashmir,OAG
Pakistani security forces enforcedly disappeared thousands of Baloch activists lawyers journalists teachers doctors. it's making me so hurt when I see @UN @amnesty & human rights activists are silent about #BalochGenocide,OAG
If there is one journalist who has called what happened to the pundits 'ethnic cleansing' it was me. What happened to them was horrible. This does not mean cowardly mobs should wander about killing Muslim cattle traders and dairy farmers,OAG

They keep abusing #Nehru. Modiji himself accused Dr Manmohan Singh and Gen Dipak Kapur of colluding with Pakistan to defeat him in Gujarat. If the unemployed youth or farmers ask tough questions to Modi he hides behind these diversionary issues,OAG
